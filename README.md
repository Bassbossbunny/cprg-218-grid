# CPRG 218 Intermediate Web Communications Grid Demo
## Week 4
This is a simple demonstration of how to use grid for simple layouts, and then adding some complexity to the grid. This repository has two examples included.

- *sports.html* which is a simple example of how to use grid to layout a page of Calgary's professional sports teams
- *testimonials.html* which is a more complex example of a testimonial webpage, showing how column and row spanning can be used.

It is not designed to be a complete exploration of flexbox, students can go further with these concepts by completing the homework checklist for the week.
